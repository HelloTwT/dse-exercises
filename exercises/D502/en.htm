<p>The Hong Kong Observatory issues hourly weather readings, which contain air temperatures of different places in Hong Kong. You can view the current weather report <a href="http://www.hko.gov.hk/textonly/v2/forecast/englishwx2.htm">here</a>. Write a program to parse an excerpt of the weather report and output the minimum and maximum temperature among the locations.</p>

<h1>Input</h1>

<p>The input is stored in the file \texttt{weather.txt}. The file consists of several lines. The exact number of lines is unknown but is not less than 20 and not more than 25. Each line describes a weather station: its location and the temperature reading (an integer).</p>
<p>For the exact format, please refer to the sample below. You may assume that none of the weather stations is out of service and the temperatures are not below zero.</p>

<h1>Output</h1>
<p>Output two integers to the standard output (screen) in one line: the minimum and maximum temperatures respectively.
